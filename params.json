{"name":"Fly, pelican, fly!","tagline":"","body":"Introduction\r\n============\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bmcorser/pelicanfly.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bmcorser/pelicanfly)\r\n\r\nThis is **pelicanfly**, a plugin for [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/)\r\nthat lets you type things like `i â™¥ :fa-coffee:` in your\r\n[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documents and have it\r\ncome out as little [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons in the browser.\r\nIt provides a minimal extension to Markdown and a plugin for Pelican.\r\n\r\nThe Pelican plugin hacks in some static assets to make this work with\r\nPelican \"out of the box\". If you just want the Markdown extension, it is\r\navailable\r\n[separately](http://bmcorser.github.com/markdown-fontawesome/).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nIt's not hard, just install via pip:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n(env)$ pip install pelicanfly\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen add to your Pelican settings, under `PLUGINS` as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nPLUGINS = [\r\n    # ...\r\n    'pelicanfly',\r\n    # ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have followed these steps correctly, next time you build your Pelican\r\nblog, pelicanfly will do its magic and convert all the `:fa-heart:` style tags\r\ninto proper nice little Font Awesome icons.
