Introduction
------------

This is pelicanfly, it minimally extends Markdown[1] and provides a plugin for
pelican[2] that adds the static assets to support this extension. If you just
want the Markdown extension, it is available separately[3]. Pelicanfly offers
shorthand codes for adding FontAwesome[4] icons to Markdown documents under
pelican.

FontAwesome
-----------

FontAwesome assets are included through the use of a git submodule[5].
Consequently, releases of this package might just be updates to that. Equally,
this package may contain old versions of FontAwesome assets.
